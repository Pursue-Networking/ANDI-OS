# RULES

Rules the Claude agent must follow when working in this repository.

## COMMITS

- Use Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, etc.).
- Keep the commit message to one short sentence.
- Never add model or co-author trailers such as `Co-Authored-By: Claude ...`. No mention of Claude, Anthropic, or any model in commit messages.

## WRITING STYLE

- Do not use em dashes.
- Do not use emoji.
- Use ALL CAPS for all titles and headings in every markdown file, including the README and milestone docs.
- Be concise.

## RECORDS

- Always keep [`RECORDS.md`](RECORDS.md) up to date. When a feature changes state (for example something from Milestone 1 is implemented), add or update a row so any other person or agent knows what is done and what is not.
- The record table columns are: MILESTONE, FEATURE, DEVELOPER, STATUS.
- Write the Developer name in capitals (JAYRAJ or BHUVNESH).
- Commit the updated `RECORDS.md` along with the feature.
- Always keep [`FIXES.md`](FIXES.md) up to date. When a problem is fixed, add a row so the same problem is not repeated. Columns are: PROBLEM, FIX, MILESTONE, CAUSE / OCCUR. Commit it with the change.

## WORKING BEHAVIOR

- If a request seems wrong, or a terminal command is taking too long, ask the user once whether to continue.
- If anything is unclear, ask the user rather than guessing.
- Read [`TCSK.md`](TCSK.md) (Things Claude Should Know) at the start of work and use it as memory of what the user wants Claude to know.

## SUGGESTED RULES

- Never commit credentials, API keys, tokens, or `.env` files. Keep secrets outside the codebase.
- Never send any email, message, or outreach automatically. Drafts only, user approval required.
- Keep each user's data separated. Do not let one user's data appear in another user's workflow.
- Do not commit directly to `main` without asking. Branch first.
- Ask before destructive or irreversible Git actions (`reset --hard`, `push --force`, history rewrites).
- Do not claim work is done until it is verified. If a step was skipped or a test failed, say so.
- Reuse existing code, helpers, and patterns before writing new ones. Prefer the smallest change that works.
